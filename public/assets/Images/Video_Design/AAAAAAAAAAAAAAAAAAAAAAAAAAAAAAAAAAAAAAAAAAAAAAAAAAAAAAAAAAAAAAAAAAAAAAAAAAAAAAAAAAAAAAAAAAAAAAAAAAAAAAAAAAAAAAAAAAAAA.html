If you post a great picture on social media, having a logo or watermark makes the image appear less attractive.

Some photographers and companies put a large watermark in the centre of the image to prove their copyright. </p><p id=\"\">‍</p><p id=\"\">But it obscures the subject of the photo. Watermarking is the only thing you can focus on, and it creates a negative impression. Watermarking, which embeds copyright information in pictures, removes unsightly watermarks but can soften the overall photo. So, both types of watermarks can distract attention from the image itself.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><h3 id=\"\">They lower the shareability of the image or video.</h3><p id=\"\">Social media can help with your brand awareness.

So, watermarks do not offer complete protection against theft.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><h3 id=\"\">Watermarks encourage a negative approach.</h3><p id=\"\">Brands use watermarks mainly to protect rights. But the appearance of watermarks can hurt your brand. Suppose you own the copyright for all your online images. In that case, you may give the impression that your viewers are more concerned about possible theft than displaying the images as intended.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><p id=\"\">So, how can you protect your photos from piracy without using watermarks?&nbsp;There are several ways to protect your unwatermarked photos from piracy and theft. You can add a copyright notice above the image and state that the image should not get used by others without permission.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><p id=\"\">You can also display your brand's logo or name in the background of the photo or video.&nbsp;Another option is to upload a low-resolution photo.

Sometimes it is important to remove and, we need a good Watermark Remover.","product-category":"63f44f27fcccf4060f8c88c7","product-body":"<p id=\"\">A watermark is an identifying image or pattern in paper that appears as various shades of lightness\\ darkness when viewed by transmitted light, caused by thickness or density variations in the paper. Its purpose is to make it more difficult for the original image to be copied or used without permission. </p><p id=\"\">‍</p><p id=\"\">Watermarks have been used on postage stamps, currency, and other government documents to discourage counterfeiting. Watermarks are typically transparent, so those viewing the image can still admire it. You can usually identify the photographer through the watermark too.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Why is it Called a Watermark?</strong></h2><p id=\"\">The term watermark comes from the way these designs are created, during the ‘wet paper’ stage of making paper, and also from the fact that a watermark resembles a damp spot. Documents, stamps and paper money all have watermarks that label them as genuine.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><p id=\"\">Fancy writing paper often includes watermarks, water marks noting their brands. And you can also use the word for a digital marker, a signal that identifies the owner of a photo, video, or audio file. In its most literal sense, watermark means a mark showing the level of a body of water.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">What are the two Types of Watermark?</strong></h2><p id=\"\">There are two types of digital watermarking, visible and invisible. A visible watermark on a file or image is very similar to a corporation’s logo on its letterhead.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><p id=\"\">&nbsp;It is basically a semi transparent identifier that is used to show the ownership of the file or image. An invisible watermark is an identifier that is embedded into a file but it is completely invisible to the eye.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Why Should you stop using Watermarks?</strong></h2><p id=\"\">‍</p><h3 id=\"\">1.Watermarks hurt your chances of getting published or featured</h3><p id=\"\">Watermarks hinder the opportunities for getting shared because they make it impossible for companies, blogs and social media channels to feature your work. Any watermarks make us skip over the image. Watermarks can really distract from an image.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><h3 id=\"\">2. No one can read your watermark anyway</h3><p id=\"\">Watermarks are made and created with the best intentions, but even so they can be impossible to read. This is especially true if you use any kind of calligraphy font. It’s tough to take, but your illegible watermark doesn’t entice anyone to hire you as a photographer, especially if they can’t read it or figure out what the logo says. </p><p id=\"\">‍</p><p id=\"\">If someone wants to credit you, they will do it in the caption or post. Best case scenario, they will do this with a link directly to your website. If you use a watermark make sure it is easily legible at very small sizes. If it isn’t legible, it only diminishes your work.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><h3 id=\"\">3. A watermark can ruin the composition of your photo</h3><p id=\"\">You have spent thousands of dollars on gear and years of your life to get that perfect shot with a composition that draws you into the image. Why would you put a distracting watermark across your photo. The temptation is to make it smaller, but the majority of watermarks look ugly at a tiny size. </p><p id=\"\">‍</p><p id=\"\">The only thing that should be added to the image is your signature on the white border around the image when you print it out and sign it personally as a limited edition part. This is the classiest way to add to a perfect image, and many cases can actually add value.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><h3 id=\"\">4. A watermark is not a signature&nbsp;</h3><p id=\"\">Many artists sign their work. Painters sign their paintings, and photographers sign prints. Of course, this is not the same as a watermark. The point of the signature is to ensure the authenticity of the painting or print. A signature is never very prominent on a painting. And prints are signed around the edge in the margin. </p><p id=\"\">‍</p><p id=\"\">This is to not detract from the piece itself. Placing a watermark on the photo draws attention away from the piece itself and keeps the viewer from enjoying it as it was meant to be experienced.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><h3 id=\"\">5. You don’t need a watermark to appear professional</h3><p id=\"\">Many photographers believe that using watermarks will make them look professional. But realistically, most well known photographers don’t use a watermark. In fact, a disruptive and poorly designed watermark is one of the things many professionals see as a sign that a photographer is just starting out.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><p id=\"\">Having consistently high quality work is what makes you appear professional. If you do have a watermark, consider hiring a designer to help you to create it and keep it small and unobtrusive.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><h3 id=\"\">6. Watermarks won’t protect you from piracy</h3><p id=\"\">It would be great if something as simple as a watermark could protect you from piracy. But unfortunately this isn’t the case. There are apps that can remove watermarks in just a few clicks. If your watermark is towards the edge of the photo. It is even easier to remove it. </p><p id=\"\">‍</p><p id=\"\">A thief can simply crop the watermark or logo out of the image. This is why a simple watermark can’t protect you. The only exception to this is a full image watermark; the kind that stock photography companies use to protect images. These are impossible to remove.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><h3 id=\"\">7. Reduce social sharing</h3><p id=\"\">Social networking sites help spread information and news. But if your photos are heavily watermarked they may not receive much attention. People tend to share images they find appealing, and some may be turned off by a web sized image with a prominent watermark.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><h3 id=\"\">8. Promotes negative image of you</h3><p id=\"\">Although a watermark is intended to protect your rights, the appearance of one could have a negative impact on your brand.
